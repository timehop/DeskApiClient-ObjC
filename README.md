# Desk API Client

DISCLAIMER: The DeskKit SDK is in Private Customer Pilot. It does not work out-of-box without a prior arrangement with the Desk.com product team. If you are interested in participating in the Private Customer Pilot, please send an email to jpappas@salesforce.com.

The Desk API Client is a lightweight static library that wraps the [Desk.com API V2](http://dev.desk.com), written in Objective-C.

The easiest way to install the library is as a cocoapod:

```
pod 'DeskAPIClient', :git => 'https://github.com/forcedotcom/DeskApiClient-ObjC.git'
```

## Usage

Create an API Oauth2 token client as follows:

```
DSAPIClient *client = [DSAPIClient sharedManager];
[client setHostname:@“mysite.desk.com”
           APIToken:@“my api token”];
```

Create an API OAuth1 client as follows:

```
DSAPIClient *client = [DSAPIClient sharedManager];
[client setHostname:@"mysite.desk.com"
        consumerKey:@"yourConsumerKey"
     consumerSecret:@"yourConsumerSecret"
        callbackURL:@"urlscheme://callback-url"];
```
