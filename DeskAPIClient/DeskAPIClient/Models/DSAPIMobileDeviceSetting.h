@interface DSAPIMobileDeviceSetting : DSAPIResource


/**
 Updates a mobile device setting by calling a PATCH to the setting's "self" link.
 
 @param dictionary A dictionary defining the updates to the setting.
 @param queue The queue on which to execute the success and failure blocks.
 @param success A block object to be executed when the task finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes one argument: the updated interaction (`DSAPIMobileDeviceSetting`) returned by the POST request.
 @param failure A block object to be executed when the request operation finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully, but encountered an error while parsing the response data. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: the `NSHTTPURLResponse` from the server, and an `NSError` describing the network or parsing error that occurred.
 @return A resumed NSURLSessionDataTask. If an error occurred this return value is nil and the failure block is executed.
